# to do
- ui layout (vulkan viewport)
	- render the scene into an image view using framebuffers
	- use the result in Imgui renderer as a texture

# future
- isolate imgui init function in its own class
- video input implementation (ex. OBS can be used as a source)
	- OBS can be used to implement scenes & sound
